A tensorflow-based zero knowledge chess engine and online chess game interface

### TODOs

[x] Setup a usable interface to the 'chessboard' for a user.
[x] Push moves to client with WebSockets (and return moves).
[x] Allow user to play against Stockfish.
[ ] Add support for multi player rather than single session.
[ ] Allow player-to-player games.
[ ] Prettify user interface a bit.

[ ] Setup a very basic game analysis (Use stockfish or similar to analyse positions on-server)
[ ] Setup an opening practise zone.
[ ] Setup an endgame practise zone.

[ ] Implement a simple minmax algorithm.
[ ] Try to make minmax good enough to beat a human.

[ ] Define a suitable feature vector for the board state.
[ ] Start work on zero knowledge ML for this chess application.
[ ] Try to make ML beat this minmax.
[ ] Consider some learned chess ML as well?
